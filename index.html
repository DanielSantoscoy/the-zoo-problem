  <p>The giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus Giraffa. 
  It is the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant on Earth. 
  Giraffes live in herds of related females and their offspring or bachelor herds of unrelated adult males, 
  but are gregarious and may gather in large aggregations.

	<p>Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals of the infraorder Simiiformes, also known as the simians. Traditionally, all animals in the group now known as simians are counted as monkeys except the apes, which constitutes an incomplete paraphyletic grouping; however, in the broader sense based on cladistics, apes (Hominoidea) are also included, making the terms monkeys and simians synonyms in regards to their scope.</p>
