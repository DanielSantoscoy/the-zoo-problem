  <p>The giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus Giraffa. 
  It is the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant on Earth. 
  Giraffes live in herds of related females and their offspring or bachelor herds of unrelated adult males, 
  but are gregarious and may gather in large aggregations.

It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. 
It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs.</p>

	<p>Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals of the infraorder Simiiformes, also known as the simians. Traditionally, all animals in the group now known as simians are counted as monkeys except the apes, which constitutes an incomplete paraphyletic grouping; however, in the broader sense based on cladistics, apes (Hominoidea) are also included, making the terms monkeys and simians synonyms in regards to their scope.</p>
